# Philosophers
Iâ€™ve never thought philosophy would be so deadly.<br>
In this project, I learned the basics of threading a process and mutexes. <br>

## Introduction

**- philo number:** how many philosophers are sitting at the table <br>
**- time to die:** time in milliseconds until a philo dies after his last meal <br>
**- time to eat:** time in milliseconds it takes a philo to eat <br>
**- time to die:** time in milliseconds it takes a philo to sleep <br>
**- number must eat:** how many times a philo must at least have eaten to end the simulation <br>
<br>

A philosopher has to announce its current status in the STDOUT, which can be: <br>
- philo n has taken a fork <br>
- philo n is eating <br>
- philo n is sleeping <br>
- philo n is thinking <br>
- philo n died <br>

## Usage

``make`` to compile all source files <br>
``./philo <philo number> <time to die> <time to eat> <time to sleep> <number must eat>`` to start the simulation
